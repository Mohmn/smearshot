## Inspiration

The idea behind the SMEARSHOT App was largely inspired by the "Mark" application by Tehleel Mir, available for Android devices on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.markOne.ss_app). Seeing the utility and popularity of the app for mobile devices, I felt that there was a gap in the market for desktop users. As a result, the SMEARSHOT App was conceived to cater to this audience, aiming to provide the same efficiency and ease-of-use to desktop users.
